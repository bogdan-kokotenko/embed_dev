//! # Introduction
//! Embedded firmware framework for MCU based application.
//! Could be used for the development of custom small embedded systems.
//! Framework contains:
//! - lightweight non-preemptive threads (protothreads);
//! - unified HAL for various popular embedded platforms;
//! - widely used algorithms implementation (CRC, averaging, queues, etc.).
//!
//!
//! For more information see:
//! - \ref examples
//! - \ref unit_tests
